# valor

Valor is a node.js boilerplate that uses express to serve web applications.

How to use:

``` shell
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/danielbonifacio/valor ./valor

# navigate to porject's folder
cd valor

# install dependencies
npm i

# truncate app (remove .git and docs folder)
npm run truncate

# development server with live reload
npm start

# watch sass (needs sass)
npm run sass:watch
```

Do not use this in production. This was made just with learning purposes.
